### How could you join us?

### -> Become our Investor:
We absolutely could not have gone this far without the investment from >100 micro/individual investors that share in our vision and invested ~$132K in our very first Token Private Sales. And Metacraft seriously focuses on the micro/individual investors from day one, even though it's shown to be a more rocky path for us. 
The sooner you purchase, the better rate you can get. And anyone can start buying from $1 to $8,000 value of MEMI.

### -> Become our Player:
Under Realm is the very first and free-to-play game that takes place in a chaotic, fragmented world of ATEM where humans and other races are constantly fighting each other, to wrench the endless thirst for power, wealth, and gradually take control over ATEM.
Steel, blood, and brute force were the main material of the savage battles until mysteriously, mankind discovered the long-lost magical scripts that allow them to summon mighty, ancient creatures/ entities that can turn the tide in no time. And no one wants to be left behind in this race. Adventurers across ATEM are desired by factions to discover the forgotten dungeons across this continent. Alpha launch in Q4/2022.
