#### ATEM
`ATEM` is the fictional world that has been long sunken in wars, conflicts and chaos; the dark realm is going to take over this world. `ATEM` is where multiple games are going to take place and each represents a period of this world history.

#### Under Realm
Under Realm is the very first and free-to-play strategy Trading card game produced by Metacraft. Under Realm takes place in a chaotic, fragmented world of `ATEM` where human and other races are constantly fighting each others, to wrench the endless thirst for power, wealth, and gradually take control over `ATEM`. 

Steel, blood and brute force were the main material of the savage battles until mysteriously, mankind discovered the long-lost magical scripts that allow them to summon mighty, ancient creatures/ entities that can turn the tide in no time. And no one wants to be left behind in this race. Adventurers across `ATEM` are desired by factions to discover the forgotten dungeons across this continent.
