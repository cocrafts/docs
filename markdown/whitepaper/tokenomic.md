### Tokenomic

Metacraft Mineral (`MEMI`) is the central token of the entire ecosystem, natively on [SOLANA blockchain](https://explorer.solana.com/address/ATEMTyZVC1yDHYUg1aqHC6cpn8KVLe4Bbn7G74xSRDqG) as an SPL token play important role connect different game/game-series under one unified token. We will distribute it as `ERC20` token on **Ethereum** blockchain when the transaction fees reasonable enough. Total supply of `MEMI` across all chain is `800,000,000` tokens — there will be no more `MEMI` to be found.

`MEMI` follow a price formula called “predictable coin” — in which, keep the price of this token semi-stable. Not by nail its value to USD or anything else, but to itself in the past — by Fibonacci schedule, the detailed mechanism is complicated but in general Metacraft predict the stage of `MEMI` in Fibonacci curve by its potential (base on community, revenue stream…) and broadcast our detailed price estimation to the community as a reference price. Thus, community might have more clues to make their decisions. We expect this “predictable coin” mechanism might offer another alternate for crypto space which is potentially scalable for global cryptocurrency adoption.

**`MEMI` is anticipated to hold the following utilities:**

- Selectively use to reward Builder based on their contribution
- Reward for Esport Championship/Tournament and `ATEM` Hero
- Game developer use `MEMI` to reward their Builders (Artist, Engineer, Writer…)
- Fees on Collaboration Platform*
- Marketplace transaction fee across all games*
- Used across all games
- Staking & Liquidity

**Fees paid by MEMI are mostly reserved for the community — and will be used with purpose to embrace Metacraft ecosystem.*

**The distribution of `MEMI` is projected as following:**
